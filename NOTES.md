## TODOs

- Could we also have the ability to replace the image on the individual project landing pages with a video hosted on Wistia? This is something Chris is going to be working on so we dont have a video ready to go yet, but I will provide a test embed code below.

-- And just in case the video has trouble loading, would it be possible to make it so that it defaults to the uploaded illustration?

-- Wistia embed code for you to test below.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fer7vsxxmy?seo=true&videoFoam=true" title="jez-john-louisa-scott_full_length oct 17, Video" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
